Insights
People in the Early Career (25-34) and Young Adult (19-24) age groups have the highest default rates.
Medium-term loans and long-term loans account for the majority of loan defaults.
Borrowers with low employment duration and low savings balances are more likely to default.
Management and unemployed individuals have higher default rates compared to skilled and unskilled workers.
Borrowers who own homes and have no other credits show lower default rates.
Education loans and loans for renovations have high default rates.
Young Adults are defaulting more on car loans than education loans.
People in the Early Career group default across all loan purposes, often due to lower income levels.
Short-term loans have the lowest default rates, while car loans have a consistently high default rate across all durations.
Loans applied for renovations tend to have the highest default rates.
Borrowers prefer to pay lower percentages of their income towards loans, as indicated by significant outliers in the 1% range.

Recommendations
Based on the insights, the following actions are suggested:

Develop financial literacy programs targeting young adults and early career individuals.
Design shorter-term repayment options with added incentives.
Provide lower interest rates for borrowers with higher savings balances.
Introduce stricter credit checks for high-risk loans like education and car loans.
Improve transparency and criteria for renovation loans.
Investigate outliers in the 1% income contribution range for better risk management.
